## 🎯 Goal

The goal is to find the relevant method without having to dig the docs 📃 with simple sentences ✍.

For example:

* You're thinking 🤔: "I have a String & I want to search in it", you can find it there. 🤩

* Or let's say you're thinking 💭: "I have an array & I would like to find one or more items in it", well the best answer can be easily searched for by using 2 levels of dropdowns that you can type in or select from. 🔥

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn serve
```

## New Language contributions

The code is modular enough to be used with other Languages (python, java, c#, etc.) without many changes.

To add new a language:

1. Update the `ui.json` file in `src/assets/json` folder;

2. Add corresponding json files for the methods in same folder.

That's it!
